			<h3>Apache</h3>
			<p>
				Janitor needs MultiViews enabled.
			</p>
			<p>
				Janitor uses Apache, the most popular web server on the internet since 1996 - we don't care about 
				other webservers, though Janitor might be made to work there as well, as long as it provides MultiViews
				and environment variables available in $_SERVER.
			</p>

			<h3>PHP</h3>
			<p>
				PHP needs to be compiled with the dom, mysqlnd, mbstring, session and SimpleXML extensions which are all
				normally part of a default installation. 
			</p>
			<p>
				PHP needs to be compiled with the imagick extension to use the image conversion API.
			</p>
			<p>
				PHP needs to be allowed to use the &lt;? syntax - set short_open_tag = On in php.ini.
			</p>

			<h3>FFMpeg</h3>
			<p>
				FFMpeg is required to perform audio and video conversions. This needs to be installed as a
				regular command-line tool - NOT as a PHP extension.
			</p>

			<h3>Git</h3>
			<p>
				Janitor uses Git submodules for including itself in your project.
